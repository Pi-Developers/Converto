#Converto
An app for confused arabic users

If you are not using arabic/english at the same time this is not for you.

**Intro :**

How many times while you are writing you found that you didn't switch the language, and instead of the "Hello world" you wrote "اثممخ صخقمي" and vice versa.

This is confusing, and makes you annoyed espically when writing a long post or something.

So, we created this simple app "CONVERTO"

**Features :**

- Convert arabic to english
- Convert english to arabic
- Written in java
- Written in python

**To-Do list :**
- Add python GUI
- Add java GUI
- upload Vb.net version (For MS Windows)

**Usage :**

For Python
- in terminal type python Converto.py

For java
- make sure you have installed java in your terminal type javac Converto.java 
- then type Converto

**Note :**
- This app was intended to be a fun -yet useful - project, but we are updating tho.
- feel free to add your language to this app and make lifes easier.
