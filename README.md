**Current version : 1.1** 

**Intro :**

How many times while you are writing you found that you didn't switch the language, and instead of the "Hello world" you wrote "اثممخ صخقمي" and vice versa.

This is confusing, and makes you annoyed espically when writing a long post or something.

So, we created this simple app "CONVERTO"

**Features :**

- Convert arabic to english
- Convert english to arabic
- Written in java
- Written in python
- Written in C# .NET
- Directly fix text (Windows only)

**To-Do list :**

- Add hotkey fix to linux/unix

**Usage :**

- For Python
-> in terminal type python Converto.py

- For java
-> make sure you have installed java in your terminal type javac Converto.java 
-> then type java Converto

- For EXE
-> just click on it :D


**Chgangelog :**
>>V1.0 :

>> - Initial release

>>V1.1 :

>> - Converted to GTK
>> - Cleaner layout
>> - Log function in Java GUI
>> - Fixed Bug in Java Console version

**Notes :**

- This app was intended to be a fun - yet useful - project, but we are updating tho.
- feel free to add your language to this app and make lifes easier.
- The linux/unix versions has no hotkey yet (will be added soon)
